Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle:
->>FIFO â†’ First In, First Out
->>The element that is inserted first is removed first.

Basic Operations on Queue:
Operation     	  Description
enqueue()     	  Add an element to the rear of the queue
dequeue()	        Remove an element from the front of the queue
peek() /front()	  View the front element without removing it
isEmpty()	        Check if the queue is empty


Queue_Type	      Insert Position	              Delete Position	              Special Feature
Linear Queue	    Rear	                        Front	                        Simple FIFO
Circular Queue	  Rear (wraps)	                Front (wraps)	                Space reused
Priority Queue	  Any (based on priority)	      Front (highest priority)	    Priority-based removal
Deque	            Both ends	                    Both ends                     Max flexibility
